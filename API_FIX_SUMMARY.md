# API Import Fix Summary

## Issue
The Company Admin and Super Admin dashboard pages were importing `api from '../lib/api'`, but this file didn't exist, causing import errors.

## Root Cause
The dashboard files were using an inconsistent import pattern compared to other admin pages:
- Dashboard files: `import api from '../lib/api'` (missing file)
- Other admin pages: `import { apiRequest } from "@/lib/queryClient"` (correct pattern)

## Solution
Created the missing `client/src/lib/api.ts` file that provides an axios-like API client interface using the existing [apiRequest](file://c:\Users\deepa\Downloads\Hire\SmartHire\client\src\lib\queryClient.ts#L10-L36) function.

## Implementation Details

### Created File: `client/src/lib/api.ts`
```typescript
import { apiRequest } from "./queryClient";

// Create an axios-like API client using our apiRequest function
const api = {
  get: (url: string) => apiRequest(url, { method: 'GET' }),
  post: (url: string, data?: any) => apiRequest(url, { method: 'POST', body: data }),
  put: (url: string, data?: any) => apiRequest(url, { method: 'PUT', body: data }),
  delete: (url: string) => apiRequest(url, { method: 'DELETE' })
};

export default api;
```

## Files Affected
1. `client/src/lib/api.ts` - NEW FILE CREATED
2. No existing files needed modification since they were already using the correct pattern

## Verification
- ✅ Client starts without import errors
- ✅ Dashboard pages can now import the API module
- ✅ API calls work correctly through the existing [apiRequest](file://c:\Users\deepa\Downloads\Hire\SmartHire\client\src\lib\queryClient.ts#L10-L36) infrastructure
- ✅ Consistent with the project's existing API calling pattern

## Testing
The client is now running successfully on http://localhost:5174 with all admin dashboard pages accessible without import errors.

## Benefits
1. Maintains consistency with existing dashboard code
2. Provides familiar axios-like interface for developers
3. Leverages existing authenticated API request infrastructure
4. Requires no changes to existing working pages
