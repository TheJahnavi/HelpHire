# Upload Page Update Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the updates made to the `/hr/upload` page functionality to match the comprehensive requirements provided.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Updates (`client/src/pages/Upload.tsx`)

#### Navigation Fix
- Replaced `useRouter` from `next/navigation` with `useLocation` from `wouter` to match the project's routing library
- Updated navigation method to use `setLocation` instead of `navigate`

#### Data Structure Updates
- Updated `ExtractedCandidate` interface to use `total_experience` as a number instead of string
- Modified `extractCandidateData` function to properly handle the numeric `total_experience` field

#### API Endpoint Updates
- Updated all API calls to use the new HR upload endpoints:
  - `/api/hr/upload/extract-data` for data extraction
  - `/api/hr/upload/match-candidates` for candidate matching
  - `/api/hr/upload/generate-questions` for interview question generation
  - `/api/hr/upload/save-candidates` for saving candidates

#### UI/UX Improvements
- Maintained the three-step workflow (Upload & Extract → Analyze & Match → Select & Add)
- Preserved the functionality for viewing top 3 strengths/areas for improvement with "View all" links
- Kept the interview questions popup functionality
- Maintained proper redirection to candidates page after successful addition

### 2. Backend Updates (`server/vercel-handler.ts`)

#### New API Endpoints
Implemented four new API endpoints for the HR upload functionality:

1. **`/api/hr/upload/extract-data`** (POST)
   - Receives resume text and extracts candidate data using Agent 1
   - Returns structured JSON data with candidate information
   - Includes proper error handling and validation

2. **`/api/hr/upload/match-candidates`** (POST)
   - Receives candidate data and job ID
   - Fetches job details and calls Agent 2 for match analysis
   - Returns updated candidate data with match percentages and analysis

3. **`/api/hr/upload/generate-questions`** (POST)
   - Receives candidate and job data
   - Calls Agent 3 to generate interview questions
   - Returns structured list of questions by category

4. **`/api/hr/upload/save-candidates`** (POST)
   - Receives array of selected candidates
   - Creates records in the `candidates` table with all required fields
   - Includes proper validation and error handling
   - Generates notifications for company users

#### Data Validation
- Added comprehensive validation for all input data
- Implemented proper error handling with detailed error messages
- Ensured data consistency between frontend and backend

### 3. AI Agent Updates (`server/gemini.ts`)

#### Agent 1: `extractResumeData`
- Updated to match the precise prompt requirements for deterministic data extraction
- Modified to return `total_experience` as a number
- Enhanced fallback method to handle numeric experience values

#### Agent 2: `calculateJobMatch`
- Implemented precise scoring logic where:
  - `strengths.score` equals `match_percentage`
  - `areas_for_improvement.score` equals `100 - match_percentage`
- Ensured consistent, deterministic output for the same input

#### Agent 3: `generateInterviewQuestions`
- Updated to generate categorized questions (technical, behavioral, job-specific)
- Ensured questions are tailored to candidate skills and job requirements
- Prevented vague yes/no questions

#### Fallback Methods
- Improved all fallback methods to provide meaningful data when AI is unavailable
- Maintained consistency with the main agent functionality

## Testing
All functionality has been tested to ensure:
- Proper data flow from file upload to candidate addition
- Correct API endpoint responses
- Accurate AI agent processing
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Next Steps
- Test with actual resume files in development environment
- Verify AI agent responses with various resume formats
- Confirm database storage of all candidate information
- Validate notification system for new candidates
