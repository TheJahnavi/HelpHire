# AI Agent Debug Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **API Key Environment Variable Mismatch**: 
   - The .env file had the API key as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - The code was looking for `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
   - **Fixed**: Updated the code to use `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`

2. **Port Conflict**: 
   - Port 5002 was already in use
   - **Fixed**: Changed to port 5003 in both .env file and server configuration

3. **API Authentication Failure**: 
   - Direct API test shows 401 "User not found" error
   - This indicates the API key is either invalid, expired, or incorrectly configured

## Current Status

- The server can start successfully on port 5003
- The AI agents are properly configured to use the OpenAI API key from the environment
- The fallback methods are working correctly (as shown in the initial test)
- The API key authentication is failing with a 401 error

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Verify API Key
- Go to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) and confirm your API key is active
- Check that the key has not expired or been revoked
- Ensure you have sufficient credits/balance

### 2. Test API Key Directly
You can test your API key using curl:
```bash
curl -X POST https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
  }'
```

### 3. Update .env File (if needed)
If you get a new API key, update the .env file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE
```

### 4. Restart Services
After updating the API key:
1. Stop the server (if running)
2. Update the .env file with the new key
3. Start the server: `npm run dev`
4. Test the upload functionality

## Fallback Behavior
The system is correctly falling back to mock data extraction when the AI service is unavailable:
- Extracts basic candidate information using regex
- Provides generic matching scores based on skill overlap
- Generates template interview questions

This ensures the application remains functional even when AI services are unavailable.
