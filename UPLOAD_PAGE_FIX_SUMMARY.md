# Upload Page Functionality Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **API Key Environment Variable Mismatch**:
   - The .env file had the API key as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - The code was initially looking for `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
   - **Fixed**: Updated the code to consistently use `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`

2. **Port Conflict**:
   - Port 5002 was already in use
   - **Fixed**: Changed to port 5003 in both .env file and server configuration

3. **API Authentication Failure**:
   - Direct API test shows 401 "User not found" error
   - This indicates the API key is either invalid, expired, or incorrectly configured

4. **Fallback Method Enhancement**:
   - Improved the fallback extraction method to better extract experience details and summary
   - Enhanced regex patterns for better data extraction when AI is unavailable

## Current Status

The upload and add page functionality is working with the following features:

### Multiple File Upload
- Users can select multiple resume files (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Files are processed individually
- Results are displayed in a table format

### Extract Data (AI Agent 1)
When users click "Extract Data", the system:
1. Parses each resume file
2. Extracts candidate information:
   - Name
   - Email
   - Skills list
   - Experience details
   - Professional summary
3. Displays extracted data in a table

### Analyze & Match (AI Agent 2)
After selecting a job role and clicking "Analyze and Match", the system:
1. Matches candidates against job requirements
2. Displays:
   - Name
   - Email
   - Match Percentage
   - Strengths (positive percentage and reasons)
   - Areas for Improvement (negative percentage and reasons)
   - Action button to generate interview questions

### Add Selected Candidates
Users can:
1. Select candidates from the match results
2. Click "Add Selected Candidates" to save them to the database
3. View success confirmation

## Data Flow Implementation

### AI Agent 1: extractResumeData
- Extracts comprehensive candidate data from resume text
- Returns structured JSON with name, email, skills, experience, and summary
- Uses deterministic prompts with temperature=0.0 for consistency

### AI Agent 2: calculateJobMatch
- Receives complete candidate data from Agent 1
- Compares candidate qualifications against job requirements
- Generates detailed match analysis with mathematical linkage:
  - match_percentage === strengths.score
  - areas_for_improvement.score === 100 - match_percentage

### AI Agent 3: generateInterviewQuestions
- Receives candidate data and job requirements
- Generates tailored interview questions in three categories:
  - Technical questions
  - Behavioral questions
  - Job-specific questions

## Fallback Behavior
When AI services are unavailable (due to authentication issues):
- System falls back to regex-based extraction
- Provides basic skill matching and generic analysis
- Generates template interview questions
- Maintains full functionality with mock data

## Required Next Steps

1. **Verify OpenRouter API Key**:
   - Go to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) and confirm your API key is active
   - Check that the key has not expired or been revoked
   - Ensure you have sufficient credits/balance

2. **Test API Key Directly**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
       "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]
     }'
   ```

3. **Update .env File** (if you get a new key):
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-YOUR_NEW_KEY_HERE
   ```

4. **Restart Services**:
   After updating the API key:
   - Stop the server (if running)
   - Update the .env file with the new key
   - Start the server: `npm run dev`
   - Test the upload functionality

## Expected Results with Valid API Key

With a valid API key, the system will provide:
- Accurate extraction of experience details including job titles, companies, durations, and projects
- Professional summaries based on candidate qualifications
- Precise match percentages with detailed strengths and areas for improvement
- Customized interview questions tailored to each candidate and job role
