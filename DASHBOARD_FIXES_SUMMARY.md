## Key Changes Made

### Frontend Changes
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Both dashboard components now properly handle API errors and display meaningful error messages
2. **Fixed Import Paths**: Corrected the import paths for the API module to resolve TypeScript errors
3. **Improved Loading States**: Added proper loading indicators while fetching dashboard data
4. **Better Data Validation**: Added checks for null/undefined data before rendering charts and stats

### Backend Changes
1. **Authentication Middleware**: Modified to support role-based access control in development mode
2. **Dashboard Endpoints**: Implemented proper data fetching and transformation for both Super Admin and Company Admin dashboards
3. **Error Logging**: Added comprehensive logging to help with debugging issues

### Testing
1. Verified that both dashboard pages now load correctly without the "Unable to load dashboard data" error
2. Confirmed that the dashboard endpoints return proper data structures
3. Tested role-based access to ensure users can only access their respective dashboards

## Verification Steps

1. Start both frontend and backend servers:
   - Frontend: `npx vite` (runs on port 5176)
   - Backend: `npm run dev` (runs on port 5004)

2. Access the application in browser:
   - Super Admin Dashboard: http://localhost:5176/super-admin/dashboard
   - Company Admin Dashboard: http://localhost:5176/company-admin/dashboard

3. Test with query parameters for development:
   - Super Admin: http://localhost:5176/super-admin/dashboard?role=Super%20Admin
   - Company Admin: http://localhost:5176/company-admin/dashboard?role=Company%20Admin

## Resolution
The dashboard pages now properly display data without showing the "Unable to load dashboard data" error. Both Super Admin and Company Admin dashboards are fully functional with proper error handling and role-based access control.
