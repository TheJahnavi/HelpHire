- Changed from direct property access to proper array validation

### 2. server/gemini.ts
- Enhanced all three AI agent prompts to be more explicit and deterministic
- Added clear instructions for JSON output format
- Added explicit temperature=0.0 setting for maximum determinism
- Added instructions to avoid additional text/markdown in responses

### 3. .env
- Changed PORT from 5000 to 5002 to avoid port conflicts

### 4. server/index.ts
- Changed default port from 5001 to 5002 to avoid port conflicts

### 5. README.md
- Updated PORT information from 5000 to 5002
- Updated GEMINI_API_KEY to OPENAI_API_KEY

## Detailed Changes

### AI Agent Improvements

#### Agent 1: extractResumeData
- Added explicit instructions to return only valid JSON with the exact structure shown
- Added clear instruction to ensure temperature=0.0 for maximum determinism
- Added instruction to not include any additional text, markdown, or explanations

#### Agent 2: calculateJobMatch
- Added explicit instructions to return only valid JSON with the exact structure shown
- Added clear instruction to ensure temperature=0.0 for maximum determinism
- Added instruction to not include any additional text, markdown, or explanations

#### Agent 3: generateInterviewQuestions
- Added explicit instructions to return only valid JSON with the exact structure shown
- Added clear instruction to ensure temperature=0.0 for maximum determinism
- Added instruction to not include any additional text, markdown, or explanations
- Added explicit requirement to generate exactly 5 questions for each category

### Data Flow Fixes

#### vercel-handler.ts
- Fixed the match-candidates endpoint to properly extract strengths and areas_for_improvement:
  ```javascript
  // Before
  strengths: matchResult.strengths?.description || [],
  areas_for_improvement: matchResult.areas_for_improvement?.description || []
  
  // After
  strengths: Array.isArray(matchResult.strengths?.description) ? matchResult.strengths.description : [],
  areas_for_improvement: Array.isArray(matchResult.areas_for_improvement?.description) ? matchResult.areas_for_improvement.description : []
  ```

### Port Configuration Fixes

#### Environment Configuration
- Updated .env file to use PORT=5002
- Updated server/index.ts to default to port 5002

## Expected Results

These changes should result in:

1. **Consistent AI Output**: The AI agents should now produce identical results for the same input due to the temperature=0.0 setting and more explicit prompts.

2. **Proper Data Flow**: The frontend should now correctly receive and display the strengths and areas for improvement data.

3. **Better Error Handling**: Improved validation and error handling in the data extraction process.

4. **No Port Conflicts**: Application should start without port conflict issues.

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the application using `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the Upload page (/hr/upload)
3. Upload a resume file
4. Click "Extract data" - verify that candidate data is extracted correctly
5. Select a job and click "Analyze and Match" - verify that match percentages, strengths, and areas for improvement are displayed
6. Click "Interview Questions" for a candidate - verify that questions are generated and displayed correctly
7. Select candidates and click "Add Selected Candidates" - verify that candidates are added to the database
