# AI Agent Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Inconsistent AI Results**: The AI agents were returning the same results even with the same input, indicating a lack of determinism.
2. **Data Structure Mismatch**: The vercel-handler.ts file was not properly extracting strengths and areas_for_improvement from the matchResult object.
3. **Prompt Structure Issues**: The prompts were too complex and not explicit enough for the AI to follow precisely.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Data Extraction in vercel-handler.ts

Updated the match-candidates endpoint to properly extract strengths and areas_for_improvement:

```javascript
// Before
strengths: matchResult.strengths?.description || [],
areas_for_improvement: matchResult.areas_for_improvement?.description || []

// After
strengths: Array.isArray(matchResult.strengths?.description) ? matchResult.strengths.description : [],
areas_for_improvement: Array.isArray(matchResult.areas_for_improvement?.description) ? matchResult.areas_for_improvement.description : []
```

### 2. Enhanced AI Prompts in gemini.ts

Updated all three AI agent prompts to be more explicit and deterministic:

#### Agent 1: extractResumeData
- Added explicit instructions to return only valid JSON with the exact structure shown
- Added clear instruction to ensure temperature=0.0 for maximum determinism
- Added instruction to not include any additional text, markdown, or explanations

#### Agent 2: calculateJobMatch
- Added explicit instructions to return only valid JSON with the exact structure shown
- Added clear instruction to ensure temperature=0.0 for maximum determinism
- Added instruction to not include any additional text, markdown, or explanations

#### Agent 3: generateInterviewQuestions
- Added explicit instructions to return only valid JSON with the exact structure shown
- Added clear instruction to ensure temperature=0.0 for maximum determinism
- Added instruction to not include any additional text, markdown, or explanations
- Added explicit requirement to generate exactly 5 questions for each category

### 3. Port Configuration Fix

Updated the application to use port 5002 to avoid conflicts:
- Updated .env file: `PORT=5002`
- Updated server/index.ts file to default to port 5002

## Expected Results

These changes should result in:
1. **Consistent AI Output**: The AI agents should now produce identical results for the same input due to the temperature=0.0 setting and more explicit prompts.
2. **Proper Data Flow**: The frontend should now correctly receive and display the strengths and areas for improvement data.
3. **Better Error Handling**: Improved validation and error handling in the data extraction process.

## Testing Instructions

1. Start the application using `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the Upload page (/hr/upload)
3. Upload a resume file
4. Click "Extract data" - verify that candidate data is extracted correctly
5. Select a job and click "Analyze and Match" - verify that match percentages, strengths, and areas for improvement are displayed
6. Click "Interview Questions" for a candidate - verify that questions are generated and displayed correctly
7. Select candidates and click "Add Selected Candidates" - verify that candidates are added to the database
